# Prediction-of-lithium-ion-batteries-SOH
Artificial Neural Network (ANN) has been used to estimate state-of-health (SOH) of lithium-ion pouch cells. The batteries were stored at different storage temperature (35°C and 60°C) and conditions (fully-discharged and fully-charged) and their capacity was recorded for the duration of 10 months at one-month intervals.
